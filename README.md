# Nicer Skies

This mod adds/changes 2 things:
 - Star rendering: stars will twinkle and be of slightly different colours

 - Nebulas! [heavily wip] This mod renders a little seed/server-dependent skybox that is 100% generated in runtime with cool shader-like nebulas.

 - Lightmap changes: The lightmap has been a little tweaked to my personal preference to be a little more vibrant and dark, but it's 100% sure that these changes will be optional in the final product.

## Warning
The mod does not work with most shaderpacks, but it does work with [Complementary Reimagined](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-reimagined) (and probably some others, but I haven't tested them).

## thanks
thanks to my kettle for boiling me tea when i least deserve it
