# Nicer Skies

This mod improves the following:
### Star rendering
Stars will twinkle and be of slightly different colours

### Nebulas 
This mod renders a seed/server-dependent skybox that is 100% generated in runtime with cool shader-like nebulas.

### Lightmap changes: 
The lightmap has been a little tweaked to my personal preference to be a little more vibrant and dark, but it's 100% sure that these changes will be optional in the final product.

## Shaders
The mod does not work with most shaderpacks, but it does work (and looks really nice) with [Complementary Reimagined](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-reimagined) (and probably some others, but I haven't tested them).
