# Nicer Skies

This mod adds/changes 2 things:
 - Star rendering: stars will twinkle and be of slightly different colours

 - Nebulas! [heavily wip] This mod renders a little skybox that is 100% generated in runtime (and soon seed/server-dependent!) with cool shader-like nebulas. The following is a preview, but *they will significantly change*.

 - Lightmap changes: The lightmap has been a little tweaked to my personal preference to be a little more vibrant and dark, but it's 100% sure that these changes will be optional in the final product.
